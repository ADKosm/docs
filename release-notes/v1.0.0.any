\release{2016-03-29}{1.0.0}{0.335.0}{
  We made it!

  This release, although relatively small on its own, is built on years of
  feedback and iteration. So these notes will be a bit more broad and cover all
  the things you may have missed since you last checked in on our little CI
  system.

  First off, a huge thanks to \hyperlink{https://pivotal.io}{Pivotal} for
  sponsoring our project and letting us work on it full-time. Over the last
  year we've had 17 team members rotating through, including 2 designers.
  Pretty sweet.

  Here's a text-form 80's montage of all the things you may have
  missed since v0.17.0, our first release:

  \note{feature}{
    \reference{build-plans} replaced the old style job config.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    A \reference{binaries}{standalone binary} distribution of
    Concourse has been introduced. (Download links to the right.)
  }

  \note{feature}{
    Caching and more efficient artifact propagation: resources fetched by
    \reference{get-step} steps are cached on the workers and efficiently
    propagated throughout steps in the build plan.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    A single Concourse can be configured with multiple pipelines dynamically.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    \reference{github-auth}{GitHub auth!}
  }

  \note{feature}{
    Custom resource types can now be added via \reference{resource_types} in
    the pipeline, rather than reconfiguring your workers.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Lots of performance improvements and optimizations, and resilience to flaky
    networks.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    \reference{fly-cli}{The \code{fly} CLI} has been entirely rewritten and is
    much more consistent in UX.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    Concourse knows its own version number and will warn you if your CLI is out
    of date.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    Tasks have explicit \reference{inputs} and \reference{outputs}, making
    artifact consumption and production a lot easier to follow.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    A new color scheme that's more colorblind-friendly.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    A whole bunch of improvements to \reference{resource-types}{core
    resources}.
  }

  ...and now for the actual 1.0 release notes, if you're upgrading
  from \reference{v0.76.0}:

  \note{feature}{breaking}{
    The Concourse BOSH release is now built for BOSH 2.0. You will
    need a recent director to upgrade. Consult
    \reference{clusters-with-bosh} for information on the new BOSH
    2.0 deployment scheme.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Resources backed by a resource type defined in
    \reference{resource_types} will now periodically check for new
    versions of the resource type and use the latest one for
    checking. Previously the same container would be reused forever
    even if a new version of the resource type was released.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    We've added \code{aria-label} attributes to all buttons in the
    UI, which should improve accessibiltiy for folks using screen
    readers. Still a ways to go overall, but this is a start.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Lots of dots in sequence in build output will now word-wrap
    once again.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    The BOSH release can now be configured to use GitHub
    enterprise endpoints for GitHub auth.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Connections from \reference{architecture-atc} to Baggage Claim
    will now retry on connection errors.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Fixed an issue where volumes would "expire" even though a build
    was still using them. Did a bunch of refactoring and now it
    should all be pretty airtight.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    We've fixed a goroutine leak on the ATC which would occur every
    time \reference{image_resource} was used.
  }
}
