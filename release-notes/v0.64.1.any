\title{v0.64.1}

\list{
  Fixed a regression in \reference{v0.64.0} (which you should check out) that
  caused \code{tags} embedded in task configs to no longer be respected.

  This configuration style is deprecated but hasn't yet been officially
  removed, since we need to add tags support to \reference{fly-execute} first.
