A resource is any entity that can be checked for new versions, pulled down
at a specific version, and/or pushed up to idempotently create new versions.
A common example would be a git repository, but it can also represent more
abstract things like
\hyperlink{https://github.com/concourse/time-resource}{time itself}.

At its core, Concourse knows nothing about things like \code{git}. Instead,
it consumes a generic interface implemented by \italic{resource types}. This
allows Concourse to be extended by configuring workers with resource type
implementations.

This abstraction is immensely powerful, as it does not limit Concourse to
whatever things its authors thought to integrate with. Instead, as a user of
Concourse you can just reuse resource type implementations, or
\reference{implementing-resources}{implement your own}.

To use resources, configure them in your pipeline via the
\reference{configuring-resources}{\code{resources}} section, and use them in
your \reference{build-plans} via the \reference{get-step} and
\reference{put-step} steps.

\section{What types are supported?}{
  Right now your best bet is to
  \hyperlink{https://github.com/concourse?query=resource}{search for
  "resource"} at the Concourse GitHub organization. These resources are baked
  in to the official Concourse distribution, so you'll have them out of the
  box.

  At some point we'd like to put together some sort of registry, and make it
  easy to extend your own deployment with third-party resource types. We're not
  there yet though.

  Be sure to read the \code{README} file for a resource to know what it does
  before using it!
