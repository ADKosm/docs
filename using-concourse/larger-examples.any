\title{Larger Examples}{larger-examples}

It's pretty hard to get going without a point of reference. This section is
listed pretty early on mostly to catch your eye: you're better off opening
these examples in a background tab and coming back to them as you peruse the
\reference{pipelines}{Pipelines} document. The examples will also link to new
concepts as they go along, though.
