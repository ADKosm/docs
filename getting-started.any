\title{Getting Started}{getting-started}

The easiest way to get a Concourse instance going so that you can learn the
concepts first-hand is by using the pre-built Vagrant boxes.

To spin up Concourse with Vagrant, run the following in any directory:

\codeblock{bash}{
vagrant init concourse/lite # creates ./Vagrantfile
vagrant up                  # downloads the box and spins up the VM
}

The web server will be running at
\hyperlink{http://192.168.100.4:8080}{192.168.100.4:8080}.

Next, download the Fly CLI from the \hyperlink{http://192.168.100.4:8080}{main
page} where there are links to binaries for common platforms.

\margin-note{
  If you're on Linux or OS X, you will have to \code{chmod +x} the downloaded
  binary and put it in your \code{$PATH}. This can be done in one fell swoop
  with \code{install $DEST path/to/fly}.
}

Out of the box, Concourse doesn't have any \reference{pipelines} configured.
That's boring. Here, have this YAML!

\codeblock{yaml}{
jobs:
- name: hello-world
  plan:
  - task: say-hello
    config:
      platform: linux
      image: "docker:///ubuntu"
      run:
        path: echo
        args: ["Hello, world!"]
}

Dump that into a \code{.yml} file somewhere, and run this random command on
your machine:

\codeblock{bash}{
$ fly set-pipeline -p really-cool-pipeline -c somewhere.yml
}

If you refresh the \hyperlink{http://192.168.100.4:8080}{main page}, you should
now see the world's tiniest \reference{pipelines}{pipeline}!

Newly configured pipelines are paused by default, to prevent them from running
freely when you're not sure what they do yet. To unpause it, you can either
reveal the pipelines sidebar via the hamburger icon in the top left and press
"play", or run:

\codeblock{bash}{
$ fly unpause-pipeline -p really-cool-pipeline
}

You can always fetch the current configuration of a pipeline by running:

\codeblock{bash}{
$ fly get-pipeline -p really-cool-pipeline
}

This pipeline configuration so far describes a single \reference{jobs}{job},
whose \reference{build-plans}{\code{plan}} has a single
\reference{running-tasks}{task}. The task simply boots up, prints \code{Hello,
world!}, and completes successfully.

Not very useful? Well, time to learn how to write your own. There are a few
ways to approach learning Concourse:

\list{
  \reference{concepts} - to learn a high-level picture of how Concourse thinks
  CI should work.
}{
  \reference{running-tasks} - to learn how a task works, by running them
  interactively with \reference{fly-execute}.
}{
  \reference{pipelines} - to learn how to continuously integrate resources
  and tasks together.
}

After all that, if you want a proper Concourse deployment (not just a local
VM), put your game face on and head over to \reference{deploying-with-bosh}.
