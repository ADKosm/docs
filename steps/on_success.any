\title{\code{on_success}\aux{: perform a step when another succeeds}}{on-success-step}

Any step can have \code{on_success} tacked onto it, whose value is a second
step to execute only if the parent step fails.

\define{on_success}{step}{
  The step to execute when the parent step succeeds. If the attached step
  fails, the outer step is considered to have failed.
}

The following will perform the second task only if the first one succeeds:

\codeblock{yaml}{
plan:
- get: foo
- task: unit
  file: foo/unit.yml
  on_success:
    task: alert
    file: foo/alert.yml
}

Note that this is semantically equivalent to the following:

\codeblock{yaml}{
plan:
- get: foo
- task: unit
  file: foo/unit.yml
- task: alert
  file: foo/alert.yml
}

...however it is provided mainly for cases where there is an equivalent
\reference{on-failure-step}, and having them next to each other is more clear.
