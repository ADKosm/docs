\release{2017-11-30}{3.7.0}{1.9.0}{
  \note{feature,security,breaking}{
    We've ripped out the old & janky PostgreSQL job from our Concourse BOSH release.
    You will have no choice but to bring your own PostgreSQL database.

    If you use the Concourse BOSH release and you haven't upgraded in a while,
    I'd suggest you check out the previous migration instructions from
    Concourse \reference{v3.5.0} and \reference{v3.6.0}.
  }

  \note{feature,breaking}{
    We've changed how we develop database migrations, so as to support down
    migrations in the future. This will hopefully mean that if you upgrade
    Concourse and for whatever reason need to back out, you'll be able to,
    instead of being stuck on a (possibly broken) latest version.

    As part of this switch, we've also squashed our migrations into one big
    bang, which should also improve startup time for fresh installations.
    However, this means that \bold{you must first upgrade to \reference{v3.6.0}
    before upgrading to \reference{v3.7.0}!}

    So, do that. You may need to anyway now that we've removed PostgreSQL (see
    previous note).
  }

  \note{feature,breaking}{
    Our BOSH release used to have a few magical mystical packages called
    \code{generated_something}. These packages would generate a RSA key every
    time they compiled, in service of automagically wiring up security
    credentials so you didn't have to put them in your manifest.

    This approach was extremely clever and whoever came up with the idea was a
    downright genius, way ahead of their time.

    We've now collectively decided that the whole approach is stupid and
    redundant now that BOSH manifests can generate their own typed variables.
    It was fun while it lasted.

    The delta for this change is described in \ghissue{1834}. You can consult
    \link{our changes to
    \code{manifests/single-vm.yml}}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/compare/concourse:4bd88f1...concourse:6c80d86#diff-3492b4974e6d847f6bafd34846ccac8e}
    for reference.

    As an alternative to hand-editing your manifest, the next release note may
    pique your interest.

  \note{feature}{
    We have started dusting off
    \link{\code{concourse-deployment}}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse-deployment}
    and using it as a central location for Concourse BOSHy deployment goodness.
    We now use it for our production deployment, as well as a few testing
    environments. We've updated the \reference{clusters-with-bosh}
    documentation accordingly.

  \note{feature}{
    We are now openly gathering feedback on one of our worst-kept-secrets: the
    Concourse dashboard view. You can access it by visiting
    \code{/beta/dashboard}.

    In this version of Concourse, we've tweaked some of the visual elements of
    the dashboard to make it more readible for installations with multiple
    teams. We've also fixed some of the pipeline states so that they make more
    sense.

    Tell us what you think about the new dashboard by dropping us a line on
    \ghissue{1829}.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    The ATC will now use a separate database connection pool for the API and
    the pipeline scheduling work. This will make it so that a bunch of slow API
    requests can't starve critical functionality.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    You can now configure \reference{resource-type-params} on a pipeline
    resource type, thanks to a PR by \ghuser{jghiloni}! This will enable users
    to use the \resource{s3} with \code{params: \{unpack: true\}}, as an
    alternative to the \resource{docker-image}.
  }

  \note{feature}{
    You can now specify a \reference{on_abort} hook on a step or on a job. It
    will run on abort. ðŸŽ‰
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Fixed an issue where selecting/copying the build output would also select
    the timestamp on the left.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    \code{fly login} will now error if arguments are mistakenly given to it.
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Turns out you could easily spam the build page by holding \code{T} to
    trigger multiple builds. We've fixed that now so it only triggers a build
    once. #YOTO
  }

  \note{fix}{
    Fixed the web UI so that it appropriately shows that you are logged out
    when your session expires.
